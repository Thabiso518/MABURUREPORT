Business Description
Who are you? 
Maburu is a team of young, passionate students and recent graduates based near the Universities of Lesotho. Because we are also students, we deeply understand the struggles and frustrations that come with laptop issues(to update Microsoft, untivirus )right before a big assignment is due. The name “Maburu” is chosen to reflect generosity, easy access, community-focused, and grassroots approach. We are not a big, faceless corporation; we are your classmates and peers who are good with technology and want to help.

What do you do?
We provide on-campus laptop services and sales via the CampusTech app (mobile and web-based). Services include:
•	Antivirus installation and updates
•	Windows activation
•	Software troubleshooting and installation
•	Hardware repairs (keyboards, screens, batteries)
•	Sale of new and refurbished laptops with 3-month pay-later plans
Who are you doing it for?
Maburu’s services are designed mainly for university students in Lesotho, because laptops have become a basic need for their education. Our target audience can be explained in two groups:
1. Primary Target – First-Year University Students
•	Why them? First-year students are usually new to campus life and often come with limited technical knowledge. Many struggle when their laptops become slow, crash frequently, or need important software installed.
•	Their challenges:
o	Struggling to install or update software like Microsoft Office or antivirus.
o	Having slow or malfunctioning laptops right before important assignments.
o	Not being able to afford expensive laptop repairs or new laptops.
2. Secondary Target – Other Students, Lecturers, and the Community
•	Other University Students (2nd year and above): Even though they may be more experienced, they still face laptop issues like slow performance, broken screens, or missing software.
•	Lecturers and Staff: They also need laptop repairs, troubleshooting, and software installations but may prefer quick, reliable, and nearby services.
•	Community Members near Universities: People living around the universities often look for cheaper laptop solutions, and Maburu provides affordable refurbished laptops and repairs.
Why do you do it for them?
Understanding the Students’ Struggles
University students in Lesotho, especially those starting their first year, face unique challenges when it comes to technology. A laptop is no longer a luxury—it is an essential tool for completing assignments, attending online classes, conducting research, and communicating with lecturers. However, many students arrive at university with laptops that are either old, slow, or lacking the necaessary software for academic work.
From observations around campus, it is clear that 40% of students’ laptops often run slowly, freeze, or crash at critical moments. This leads to frustration, missed deadlines, and reduced academic performance. First-year students, who are still adjusting to campus life, struggle the most because they do not yet know where to find affordable and reliable technical help.
Maburu exists to close this gap. We do it for them because we are students ourselves, and we understand exactly how stressful it is to face laptop problems right before a big assignment or presentation. By offering support that is both affordable and accessible through a simple app, Maburu ensures students can focus on their education without being held back by technology issues.
We aim to eliminate these barriers, allowing students to remain productive and focused on their studies.
Why do you think they will choose you?
•	On-campus availability: Services are conveniently located near students’ daily environment.
•	Affordability: Competitive pricing with a simple M150 registration fee (waived for students purchasing laptops from us).
•	Flexibility: Installment plans for students waiting for bursary payments.
•	Student understanding: As fellow students, we understand their needs and tailor solutions accordingly.
•	Convenience through technology: The CampusTech app allows easy service booking, tracking, and payments.
